# Welcome to Birdlance! #

## What is the birdlance blockchain and coin(BLNC)? ##
Birdlance runs it's own Proof Of Stake Blockchain(based on NXT).
Our utility coin(BLNC) can be used for buying and selling photographs on the platform and buying various Birdlance services. 
Since the Birdlance Blockchain doesn't require any mining, but rewards are gained by staking, it is a lot more energy efficient and green then any other Proof Of Work Blockchain.
